# Mylyn Gitlab Connector


The Mylyn Gitlab Connector allows you to connect Mylyn to your self hosted Gitlab instance in order to manage your issues on Gitlab with your local Eclipse instance.


## Features

* create, edit, close and reopen issues
* comment on issues
* search for issues using regular expressions
* supports project milestones and assignees
* supports three priorities (low, normal, high) and three types (bug, feature, story) using labels. You don't have to use this feature, but if you want to use "type:bug" and "priority:high" as labels (comma separated)


## Missing features

* Password prompt
* Attachments. Downloading attachments should be possible, but not implemented though. Uploading attachments doesn't seem to be possible with the current Gitlab API.
